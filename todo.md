TODO:

1. Task Scheduler System
Design a system to manage tasks that can be scheduled for execution at specific times. Each task should have properties like:

Task ID
Task Name
Task Status (Pending, Running, Completed, etc.)
Scheduled Time
Execution Time
You should implement features like:

Add a task
Remove a task
Update a task
Run tasks based on their scheduled time
Support rescheduling of tasks
Handle task dependencies (one task should be executed after another)
Challenge: Optimize the scheduler to handle tasks with varying intervals.
